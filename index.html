      NOTE:
      This demo works most reliably in the latest versions of Chrome on Windows
      and MacOS. There is an issue where TensorFlow.js is not working properly
      on Linux versions of Chrome.
      <br><br>
      A stripped-down model of CREPE is running on this browser,
      which has less then 3 percent of parameters. The performance of
      this online demo therefore may not be as good as reported
      in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06182">paper</a>,
      and it may make more octave errors than the full model.
      To run the model with the full capacity, check out the Git repo at
      <a href="https://github.com/marl/crepe">https://github.com/marl/crepe</a>
      and follow the instructions in README.md.
      <br><br>
      The model is trained on 16 kHz audio, and due to the imperfect resampling
      in the browser, this demo works best when the hardware sample rate is
      a multiple of 16000 Hz. Your sample rate is <span id="srate"></span> Hz.
      <br><br>
